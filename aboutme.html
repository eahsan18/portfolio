  <i><h2>About Me</h2></i>
<p>Hi! My name is Eshana Ahsan. I am 16 years old and I live in New York. I am new to programming, having little experience inside the classroom but have been interested in coding since I was young. I aim to learn more about programming before college and hopefully pursue a career in web design when I am older. Outside of coding, I enjoy listening to music and exercising. However, even though it may sound contradictory with my love for exercising, I prefer being indoors rather than outdoors. I would rather exercise in a gym than go hiking outdoors. A fun fact about me is that my favorite color is purple!</p>
