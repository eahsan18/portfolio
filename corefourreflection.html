  <h2>Variables</h2>
  <p>Variables are a way to store information onto our computer. They label data with names that are simple for the user and the computer to understand. Variables can be equatede to integers, decimals, words, etc.</p>
  <p>ex: herName = "Eshana"</p>
  <p>In real life, this code would be said as "Her name is Eshana."</p>
  <h2>Loops</h2>
  <p>A loop is a set of code that is followed while or until a certain condition is met. When that condition is met, the program moves on to the next line of code but until the condition is met, it keeps repeating the code within the loop.</p>
  <p>ex: for i in range(3):</p>
  <p> t.forward(50)</p>
  <p>In real life, this code would be interpreted as "Move 't' forward 50 units 3 times."</p>
  <h2>Conditionals</h2>
  <p>Conditionals use boolean to perform certain actions only when certain conditions are true. Conditionals include if, if else, and elif. If a condition is true, it runs through a specific block of code. If it is false, it will run through a different block of code.</p>
  <p>ex: enter = input("Do you want to enter?")</p>
  <p> if enter == "yes":</p>
  <p> print("You have entered!")</p>
  <p> else:</p>
  <p>  print("Error. Wrong Answer.")</p>
  <p>In real life, this code would be said as "If the user says yes to entering the building, enter the building. If they do not say yes, display an error message"</p>
